# Sp3llsWizard
This repository contains the implementation and experimental toolbench presented in the paper â€œFrom Sound Workflow Nets to LTLf Declarative Specifications by Casting Three Spells". This work introduces a systematic approach to synthesize declarative process specifications from safe and sound Workflow nets, ensuring that the original behavior is fully preserved. Here, you'll find the complete toolchain and experimental setups, tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the correctness and scalability of our implemented algorithm. 

## Overview
Sp3llsWizard is an approach designed to formally synthesize DECLARE specifications from sound Workflow nets. The proof-of-concept implememtation automatically generates LTLf constraints from an input Workflow net in the form of a pnml file.


## Evaluation
We evaluated our algorithm on a range of both synthetic and real-world data. For the real-world testbed, we take as input processes discovered by a well-known imperative process mining algorithm from a collection of openly available event logs. We conducted the performance tests on an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU at 4.00 GHz with 32 GB RAM running Ubuntu 24.04.1.
