# Sp3llsWizard

This repository contains the implementation and experimental toolbench presented in the paper â€œFrom Sound Workflow Nets to LTLf Declarative Specifications by Casting Three Spells"

## Overview

Sp3llsWizard is an approach designed to formally synthesize DECLARE specifications from sound workflow nets. The proof-of-concept implememtation automatically generate LTLf constraints from an input Workflow net in the form of a pnml file.


## Evaluation

We evaluated our algorithm on a range of both synthetic and real-world data.
